# About This Repository

In this project, developed for a university course, we explored the REST architectural pattern. REST allows the separation of backend and frontend components, and enables different parts of the service (e.g., database, backend, and frontend) to be hosted on separate servers. Communication between components is handled via API calls that use standard HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE). The client receives feedback on the status of each request through HTTP response codes. All data in this service is exchanged in JSON format.

The project uses the following technologies:

- XAMPP – as the environment for the backend, web server, and hosting the database (MariaDB)
- PHP – for building the backend
- JWT (JSON Web Token) – for user authentication
- JavaScript and HTML – for developing the web application
- Python – for building the CLI client
